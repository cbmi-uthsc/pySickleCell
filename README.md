# pySickleCell
Python-based standalone application for sickle cell disease prediction

Description: A prevalent genetic disorder sickle cell disease (SCD), which is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States, has been affecting millions of people worldwide, resulting in multiple acute and chronic complications including pain crises, stroke, and kidney disease. It has been seen that SCD tends to lead to organ failure more compared to other chronic organ dysfunctionings. It is not feasible and possible to detect acute physiological deterioration which leads to organ failure, though.
A solution to earlier identification of this problem, which could potentially cut down the mortality rate, is the usage of the machine learning techniques that are recognizing, with the help of physiological markers, which organs are failing and forewarning of the order in which organ failure could occur over a span of time at the further extension of the project.
