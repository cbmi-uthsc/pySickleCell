# pySickleCell
Python-based standalone application for sickle cell disease prediction

Description: A prevalent genetic disorder Sickle cell disease (SCD) has been affecting people thus resulting in multiple acute and chronic complications including pain crises, stroke, and kidney disease. It has been seen that the patients who suffer with SCD tend to lead to organ failure among other chronic organ dysfunctioning. Although it is not feasible and possible to detect acute physiological deterioration which leads to organ failure.
A solution to earlier identification of this which could potentially cut down the mortality is usage of machine learning techniques through which the failure of organs occurring from physio markers are recognised and with the projectâ€™s further extension, forewarning of the order in which organ failure could occur over a span of time could be signaled.
